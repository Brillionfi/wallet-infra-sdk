# üìö Wallet Infra SDK Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Wallet Infra SDK! This guide will help you navigate our powerful toolkit for managing wallets, transactions, and assets within the Brillion ecosystem.

## üöÄ Installation

Install the Wallet Infra SDK into your project with a single command:

```shell
npm install @brillionfi/wallet-infra-sdk
```

## üîë Obtain your API key

Visit the Brillion Dashboard to set up your organization and create your first application. This process will give you a unique API key (`appId`).

## ‚ö° Initialize the SDK

To start using the SDK, you need to initialize it with your API key:

```ts
import { WalletInfra } from "@brillionfi/wallet-infra-sdk";

// Initialize the SDK
const appId = "your-app-id";
const baseUrl = "your-base-url";
const walletInfra = new WalletInfra(appId, baseUrl);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to replace `"your-app-id"` with the actual API key you obtained from the Brillion Dashboard.
