## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the `wallet-infra-sdk`.

### Committing

We use [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), in order to handle versionning and common commit message formats.

Instead of `git commit`, committing can be done with `npx cz`, or ideally, after installing Commitizen on your machine, `git cz`.
